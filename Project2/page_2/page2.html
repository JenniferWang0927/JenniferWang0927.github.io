                <p>  I saw a familiar face in the park. I didn't want to bother him and I did not want to act like a stalker
                    either. So I kept distance. I opened up instagram and saw his latest post, he just posted a picture and a location of this park! So i messaged him and ask him to turn around.
                    We have not met after graduation, it is such a big surprise.</p>
