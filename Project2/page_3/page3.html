                <p>It is a hot summer,  so we decided to check on Yelp for the 
                    best tasting icecream shop. Luckily, the icecream  shop in 
                    the park seemed nice and we went there.
                    We also took a picture of us holding our crepe icecream. While we were eating the icecream, we chat about 
                    our high school and how are we doing after graduation.
